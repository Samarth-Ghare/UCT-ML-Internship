# UCT-ML-Internship# 🚜 Crop Production Prediction in India (2001–2014)

This project is part of the **UCT Machine Learning Internship (6 weeks)** and focuses on building a machine learning model to predict agricultural crop production in India using real government data from 2001–2014.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Domain**: Agriculture
- **Objective**: Predict crop production using features like crop type, year, cost of production, and yield.
- **Data Source**: [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in) & compiled CSVs
- **ML Model**: Random Forest Regressor

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

India, being one of the largest agricultural economies, faces several challenges in accurately predicting crop production due to inconsistent climatic conditions, variety of soil zones, and economic fluctuations. The project aims to address this using machine learning models trained on historical crop data.

---

## 📂 Dataset Summary

We merged multiple datasets covering:

- Crop production (2006–2011)
- Cost of cultivation (A2+FL, C2)
- Cost per quintal
- Crop yield
- Crop variety, season, and recommended zones

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for EDA)

---

## 📊 Results

- **RMSE**: Reasonable error margin based on real-world data
- **R² Score**: Indicates good fit using minimal features (Crop, Year, Cost, Yield)
